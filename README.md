###Our Philosophy

At ZZROT we handle web development and design differently than most other companies. We believe that web management should be handled with the same level of professionalism and scrutiny that a company would expect from a CPA who does their taxes or a CFA who manages their wealth. We aren’t looking for a one off deal where we build websites, and then never see you again. We want to build a relationship because web development and design is an ongoing process. The web is constantly evolving to new standards and new technologies. When better technologies come out, we implement them into our customer’s code. We can’t do that with a one time deal and you would be missing out on the benefits of an ever evolving web. 

Here’s an example: SSL Certificates - these allow the Web Browsers to encrypt traffic to your website. Previously, websites that weren’t handling sensitive details believed they didn’t need to get a SSL Certificate, especially because they were expensive. Google has now hinted that SSL is going to have a large impact in search results in the next few months. All major web browsers have also announced that instead of just showing a Green lock for SSL websites, they will be showing a red X for all websites without SSL. This is our job as web developers to keep track of things such as these and ensure that as our client, you website adheres to them so that you can get the best ROI from your website.
